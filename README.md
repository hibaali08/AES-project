# AES-project

AES- Web Encyption App
A lightweight web application built using Flask and Tailwind CSS that performs AES-128 encryption and decryption of 128-bit plaintext using a 128-bit key.
This project is a practical implementation of symmetric key cryptography based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.
